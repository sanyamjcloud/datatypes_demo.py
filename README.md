# Python Data Types Demonstration

## Task Overview
This project demonstrates how Python handles different data types, type conversion,
error handling, and dynamic typing. The script was created as part of an internship
task to understand Python fundamentals related to data and memory.

## Files Included
- `datatypes_demo.py` – Python script demonstrating data types and operations
- Terminal output screenshot (execution proof)

## Concepts Covered
- Integer, Float, String, Boolean data types
- Checking variable types using `type()`
- Arithmetic operations
- Type conversion (string to int and float)
- Error handling using try-except
- String and number concatenation
- Dynamic typing in Python

## How to Run the Script
1. Open terminal in the project directory
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python datatypes_demo.py
